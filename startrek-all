Savor the fruit of life, my young friends.  It has a sweet taste when it is
fresh from the vine.  But don't live too long; the taste turns bitter after
time.

The only real question is whether you believe in the legend of Davy Crocket or not.
If you do, there should be no doubt in your mind that he died a hero's death.
If you do not believe in the legend then he was just a man,
and it does not matter how he died.
